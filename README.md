hi!
i'm studying urban tech + cs (computer science & complex systems).

i like everything relating to cities, products, and solving complex problems.

i've always valued intuitive design and decision-making that enable users to experience products seamlessly. Therefore, I strive to perfect my craft by working on projects, studying beyond schoolwork, and maintaining a strong desire to learn continuously.
